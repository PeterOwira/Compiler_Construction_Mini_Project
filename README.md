Recursive Descent parser
*************************
Recursive-descent parsing is a top-down method of syntax analysis in whicha set of recursive procedures is used to process the input. One procedure is
associated with each nonterminal of a grammar. Here, we consider a simple formof recursive-descent parsing, called predictive parsing, in which the lookaheadsymbol unambiguously determines the 
ow of control through the procedure
body for each nonterminal. The sequence of procedure calls during the analysis
of an input string implicitly denes a parse tree for the input, and can be usedto build an explicit parse tree, if desired.
